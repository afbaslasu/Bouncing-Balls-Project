# Bouncing-Balls-Project
A program that shows how Javascript Objects make little balls bounce around on the screen and change color when they touch each other.

In this project, I will write a program that will show how Javascript Objects can be used in making little balls bounce around on the screen, and change color when they touch each other. The project uses the Canvas API to draw the balls to the screen, and the "requestAnimationFrame" API in animating the whole display.
It checks whether the balls have hit the screen, or collide with each other and bounce them off the screen walls and change their colors respectively.
